## About This Project
Resilient Cyberspace Generative Framework with Communication, Sensing and Learning Integration (ReCygne) is a JST ASPIRE project consisting of Japan resaerch team (UEC and TIT) and UOulue and UWindsor. ReCygne aimst to develop a cutting-edge cyber-physical fralework for resilient society development with aritifical intelligence. For this purpose, we have research collabtation with three technical experts, i.e., semantic communications, data-drive sensing, and distributed learning.
